# Multiple Disease Predictor
## About
This webapp was developed using Flask Web Framework. The models used to predict the diseases we trained on large Datasets. This webapp can predict following Diseases:
* Diabetes
* Breast Cancer
* Heart Disease
* Kidney Disease
* Liver Disease
* Malaria
* Pneumonia

## Models with their Accuracy of Prediction
Disease | Type of Model | Accuracy
--- | --- | ---
Diabetes | Machine Learning Model | 98.25%
Breast Cancer | Machine Learning Model | 98.25%
Heart Disease | Machine Learning Model | 85.25%
Kidney Disease | Machine Learning Model | 99%
Liver Disease | Machine Learning Model | 78%
Malaria | Deep Learning Model(CNN) | 96%
Pneumonia | Deep Learning Model(CNN) | 95%
